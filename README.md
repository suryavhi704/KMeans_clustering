# K-Means Clustering Project 🚀

## Overview

Welcome to the **K-Means Clustering** project! This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and visualization.

## Features 🔥

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared data for clustering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gained insights through statistical analysis and visualizations.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Implemented the algorithm to group similar data points.
- **WCSS Analysis**: Used the **Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)** method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Visualization**: Plotted clusters using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for better interpretability.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

This project utilizes the following libraries:

- **Pandas** - For data manipulation
- **NumPy** - For numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - For data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn** - For machine learning and clustering

## Installation 📥

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/suryavhi704/KMeans_clustering
 cd kmeans-clustering
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 🚀

Run the Python script to execute the clustering analysis:

```bash
python kmeans_clustering.py
```

## Results 📊

The project outputs insightful visualizations such as:

- Elbow Method Graph (WCSS vs. Number of Clusters)
- Scatter plots showing clustered data points
